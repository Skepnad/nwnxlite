# nwnxlite
Windows MySQL connector for NWN:EE

# Quick start guide:

- Copy everything from bin/dist/ into the folder where your nwserver.exe resides
- Copy nwnxlite.ini into that folder, and edit the settings
- Add nwnxlite.nss to your module. The API is compatible with the aps_include.nss available for NWN 1.69

## Updating

When a new version of NWN:EE is released, the bin/dist/offests.txt file is updated. Simply overwrite your old version with the new one when you update nwserver.exe
